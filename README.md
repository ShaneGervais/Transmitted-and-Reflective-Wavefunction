# Transmitted-and-Reflective-Wavefunction
Calculating the transmission and reflective coefficients of a given wavefunction with set parameters for the wavenumber K and the potential energy V.

This class was done on ubuntu linux and will need to install the eigen3 class which can be done so (on linux) by: sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev libeigen3-doc
in the command prompt.
